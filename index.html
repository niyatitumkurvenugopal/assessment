                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Quality education has become a buzz word in the field of Technical education. Industries and research institutes are looking for skilled Engineers who are readily deployable or will become productive with minimum training and are able to take up challenges of future industrial requirements. It is expected that India with its strong heritage and better education will emerge as a knowledge hub in this century and will become super power by the year 2050. Right Education and better skill development activities are only the mantra to address these requirements. One name which is striving to meet these requirements through quality education is SRI SIDDHARTHA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, TUMKUR, KARNATAKA â€“ SSIT.
